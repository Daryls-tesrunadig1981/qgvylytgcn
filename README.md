OMG, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Alarum and seriously, it was something. Like, halfway through I was like “what even is this?” So much drama and weird stuff going on. I’m not entirely sure if I loved it or just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 a trainwreck I couldn’t look away from, you know what I mean?

And the characters! Some were kinda interesting, but then there were these bizarre jumps where you just have to go “okay... sure.” 😂 Honestly, does anyone know what the protagonist was up to half the time? Just floating around in their own world, I guess, but aren’t we all, haha?

Speaking of which, I’m still wrapping my head around that ending. How does that even fit with what happened before? Like, maybe it’s deep or some arty thing and I’m just missing it? Anyway, if I ever suggest you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , just remember this talk. 

> Oh! And the soundtrack was really decent, though, I’m not gonna lie. Felt like it was trying hard to be intense but also chill? Vibes all over the place. And yet I kinda liked it in a weird way. 

Should I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again or just let it simmer in my mind like some bizarre soup... 😂 Some scenes were PURE chaos and I'm secretly here for it, even if it left me blinking at the screen, low-key baffled like every other minute.

console.log(Why am I even typing code here?);

But hey, tell me how your day was! Enough of my   rant; gotta hear about some sane real-life adventures after all this cinematic circus. 😊
